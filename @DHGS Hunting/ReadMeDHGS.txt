[h1][b]Individual Species Weight Classes[/b][/h1]

All hunting type animals will have a unique weight class
when killed, enabling communities to launch more in-
depth hunting events for members to engage in 
together.

[h1][b]All New Animal Skulls[/b][/h1]

All hunting animals within The Best Damned Hunting Mod will also
drop a skull and pelt with it’s corresponding weight and description
for just in case if your friends don’t believe you actually killed that 
600 lb bear you were telling them about.


[h1][b]Trophy System[/b][/h1]

We decided, since the animals in our mod possess realistic
weight class ranges, it was due time players had a way to
display their biggest and best kills proudly and in style.
With our wall mounted trophy kit system, there will be no
question who the apex predator truly is.



[h1][b]Taxidermy Now Included![/b][/h1]

The Best Damned Hunting Mod now includes taxidermy! With 
our new addon, not only will you get the Best Damned
Hunting experience possible, but you can also preserve
your kill as a lifelike taxidermied statue to let 
the rest of the survivors know who the true outdoor Chad
really is!

[h1][b]Note:[/b][/h1]

In the mod's files, we've included a repackable .pbo 
that you can use in your own server pack called
"DHTaxidermyCargo.pbo" to allow 100 slots of storage
on the placed mount to give servers more ways to use 
the mod. By default, the mounts have zero storage.


[b]Item Requests Taken :D [/b]

You may run this on monetized servers as long no item from this pack is monetized.
